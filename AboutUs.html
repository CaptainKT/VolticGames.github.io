      <h3>About Voltic</h3>
      <p>Hello! Welcome to the Voltic Gaming Community we are so happy you are here to join the community. This community was created by Kellen, Jared, and Trevor and to give you a little more information about who we are were three best friends who had the idea of creating a community for a while but never really got into it until now! I personally wanted to create a community with the goal to give people a safe place to come play games with and not feel the pressure of the outside world. Jared also shares the same goals but also wants it to be about having a community where people are not going to judge you or care about ranks, a place that people can play and not care who is around them because everyone is friendly. </p>
